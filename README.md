# 🤖 copilot-nodejs-todo

Discover how to use GitHub Copilot to quickly build a Node.js application with Azure Cosmos DB and App Service.

👉 [See the workshop](https://aka.ms/ws/copilot-todo)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+
- An Azure account ([sign up for free here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-yolasors))

You can use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) to work on this project directly from your browser: select the **Code** button, then the **Codespaces** tab and click on **Create Codespaces on main**.

You can also use the [Dev Containers extension for VS Code](https://aka.ms/vscode/ext/devcontainer) to work locally using a ready-to-use dev environment.

## Project details

This project is structured as monorepo and makes use of [NPM Workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/using-npm/workspaces). It's organized as follows:

```sh
.devcontainer/    # Dev container configuration
.github/          # GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
packages/         # The different parts of our app
|- server/        # The Express server, hosting the API and the website
+- client/        # The website client
package.json      # NPM workspace configuration
```

## How to build the project

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will build the client and server packages.

## How to setup deployment

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This command will ask you to log in into Azure and GitHub, then set up the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` repository secrets for deployment.

## How to run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application will then be available at http://localhost:4200.

> **Important note**: you need to set the environment variables `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_KEY` to a valid [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/cosmos-db?WT.mc_id=javascript-0000-yolasors) instance for the server to work. You can use the [Try Cosmos](https://cosmos.azure.com/try/) website to get one for testing without the need to deploy one yourself (choose *Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL*).
