# ðŸª¶ ng-lite-todo

> Todo-list app built with (minimal) Angular.

## Tasks

This project works the same way as any Angular project, by using either the included NPM scripts or the Angular CLI directly:

- `npm start`: run dev server at `http://localhost:4200/`
- `npm run build`: build the project in the `dist/` directory.
